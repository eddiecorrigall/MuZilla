# MuZilla

A Chrome extension that:
- finds the dominant colour of the current webpage,
- finds an album whose colour matches closest to it, then
- plays a random song from the album.

@eddiecorrigall, @psobot, @younjin, and @tmcneely worked on this project during [Monthly Music Hackathon 1.0](http://www.meetup.com/Monthly-Music-Hackathon-TORONTO/).
